## Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD researcher at KU Leuven. I work with Prof. Tom Van Cutsem in the DistriNet Research Unit on distributed systems and decentralised applications.

I completed my master's at Tsinghua CS. Before this, I had an amazing four years studying Computer Science at Lancaster University for my undergrad - it was a journey full of learning, growth, and unforgettable experiences.
